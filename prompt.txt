i want to create new sidebar under the main menu as ROSTER under roster i want 2 subheading in which user can update and in other user can view the roster in table format in which there will be all the users should be there with the heading emp name and dates should be there according to the number of days in the month and in the update user can update their schedule it should reflect in the calender in the view heading  as there are the two subheading under the roster one is Update Schedule and other View Schedule
AND THE VIEW SCHEDULE SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS - this should be shown in calender not in excel cells  to the users but for the admin/manager will be see like in this in excel type because admin/manager have to see roster of all users thats why give the all the user personal calender i which all the tasks assigned to them should reflect also users can update their own roster it will be also reflected in the calender
Create a dynamic monthly planning table titled “Monthly (month_name)” with the following rules:

The first column should be labeled EMP NAME.

Columns should be generated based on the selected month:

January → Columns labeled 1 to 31

February → Columns labeled 1 to 28

March → Columns labeled 1 to 31

(Extendable for other months as required)

Each row represents one employee.

Activities (e.g., Audit, Monthly Visit, ROC Filing) should be displayed as continuous blocks spanning the relevant day columns.

Cells should remain blank where no activity is assigned.

The layout should be suitable for Excel or spreadsheet-based reporting.

IN THE UPDATE SCHEDULE
i want the users can add there schedule then i will be reflected in the view schedule the user can add only their profile's roster not of any other user 
and the db is im using firestore db if you need you can create composite indexes accordingly
